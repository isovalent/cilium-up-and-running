- Might need to fix Kind and Kubectl version. Docs created with kind v0.26.0 go1.23.4 darwin/arm64 and Kubectl v1.32.
- Might need to fix Cilium and Cilium CLI. Right now, 1.17.0 and v0.18.0.
- Might need to update kind cluster name (either default `kind` to `cilium-up-and-running-cluster` for example)
