# Repository Reorganization Summary

## Overview

This repository has been systematically reorganized to follow a consistent use-case-based structure that improves usability, maintainability, and educational value. The reorganization includes enhanced Makefile automation with simplified syntax.

## Key Changes

### 1. Simplified Makefile Syntax

**Before:**
```bash
make up CHAPTER=chapter03
make down CHAPTER=chapter03
```

**After:**
```bash
make up chapter03 USE_CASE=basic-policies
make down chapter03
make manifests chapter06 USE_CASE=lb-ipam/basic
```

- Chapters are now positional arguments (no more `CHAPTER=` required)
- USE_CASE support for granular control within chapters
- Support for nested use cases (e.g., `lb-ipam/basic`)

### 2. Consistent Directory Structure

Each chapter now follows this pattern:
```
chapterXX/
├── common/                    # Shared files for the chapter
│   ├── kind.yaml             # Chapter-specific cluster config
│   └── values.yaml           # Common Cilium values
├── use-case-1/               # Individual use cases
│   ├── README.md             # Use case documentation
│   ├── manifests/            # Kubernetes manifests
│   ├── kind.yaml             # Use case specific config (optional)
│   └── values.yaml           # Use case specific values (optional)
└── use-case-2/
    ├── README.md
    └── manifests/
```

### 3. Chapter-by-Chapter Organization

#### Chapter 3: Network Policies
- **basic-policies/**: L3/L4 network policies
- **l7-policies/**: HTTP-based L7 policies

#### Chapter 4: IP Address Management (IPAM)
- **ipv4-ipv6-support/**: Dual-stack and IPv6-only configurations
- **kubernetes-ipam/**: Kubernetes native IPAM
- **cluster-scope-ipam/**: Cluster-scoped IPAM pools
- **cluster-scope-ipam-small/**: Small cluster IPAM demonstration
- **multi-pool-ipam/**: Multiple IPAM pools
- **eni-mode/**: AWS ENI mode IPAM

#### Chapter 5: Datapath Modes
- **intra-node/**: Intra-node communication optimization
- **native/**: Native routing datapath
- **vxlan/**: VXLAN encapsulation mode
- **geneve/**: Geneve encapsulation mode

#### Chapter 6: Services and Load Balancing
- **iptables-without-cilium/**: Standard Kubernetes services
- **kube-proxy-replacement/**: Cilium kube-proxy replacement
- **session-affinity/**: Session affinity demonstration
- **lb-ipam/**: Load balancer IP address management
  - **basic/**: Basic LB IPAM
  - **important-pool/**: Priority pool demonstration
  - **no-first-last/**: Exclude first/last IP addresses
  - **start-stop-range/**: IP range configuration

### 4. Shared Resources

- **common/kind.yaml**: Default cluster configuration (3 nodes, K8s v1.33.0)
- **Symlinks**: Used strategically to share common manifests between related use cases
- **Fallback logic**: Makefile automatically uses chapter common files when use-case specific files don't exist

## Usage Examples

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Deploy a specific use case
make up chapter03 USE_CASE=basic-policies

# View manifests without deploying
make manifests chapter04 USE_CASE=multi-pool-ipam

# Deploy nested use case
make up chapter06 USE_CASE=lb-ipam/basic

# Clean up
make down chapter03
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Deploy cluster with specific configuration
make up chapter05 USE_CASE=geneve

# 2. View the deployed manifests
make manifests chapter05 USE_CASE=geneve

# 3. Test your configuration
kubectl get pods -n kube-system

# 4. Clean up when done
make down chapter05
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All chapters follow the same organizational pattern
2. **Granularity**: Each use case is isolated and independently testable
3. **Documentation**: Every use case has its own README explaining purpose and testing
4. **Automation**: Enhanced Makefile reduces command complexity
5. **Flexibility**: Nested use cases support complex scenarios
6. **Maintenance**: Shared resources reduce duplication

## Container Runtime Compatibility

Docker scripts have been created alongside existing Podman scripts for broader compatibility:
- `03-deploy-openbao-docker.sh`
- `04-configure-openbao-docker.sh`
- `05-retrieve-ca-certs-docker.sh`

## Migration Guide

If you were using the old syntax:
```bash
# Old way
make up CHAPTER=chapter03

# New way - specify a use case
make up chapter03 USE_CASE=basic-policies
```

The new structure provides much more granular control over what gets deployed and tested.

## Testing

All reorganized chapters have been tested with the new Makefile syntax:
- ✅ Chapter 3: basic-policies and l7-policies
- ✅ Chapter 4: All IPAM use cases
- ✅ Chapter 5: All datapath modes  
- ✅ Chapter 6: All service use cases including nested lb-ipam

## Future Enhancements

The new structure supports:
- Easy addition of new use cases
- Cross-chapter resource sharing
- Automated testing of individual use cases
- Better CI/CD integration possibilities
